Thank you for opening a Pull Request! Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:

- [ ] Make sure to open an issue as a [bug/issue](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-ruby/issues) before writing your code!  That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea.
- [ ] Follow the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). Most importantly, ensure the tests and linter pass by running `bundle exec rake ci` in the gem subdirectory.
- [ ] Update code documentation if necessary.
